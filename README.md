# LearnParticles2dQML
Goal - Learn all aspects of QML Particles
 
Particle editor will allow you to create your particles interactively.

This is a work in progress (just started!) application purely for learning the Qt particle system
and a few other things that I have been wanting to practice, like Shapes and user
interaction with the UI controls.

## FEATURES (In Progress)
- Create any number of emitters and edit there shape (ShapePath) and position on the screen
- Hide the editor function and shapes to see the final ShaderEffect

## TODOS and IDEAS
- Creation of all types of Particle elements (Effectors, Particle Painter, Particle Groups)
- Save and restore of setup (JSON?)
- Export the creation to QML files for use in other applications
- Add an editor pane (like QmlDesigner does) for each element
- any other idea that comes to mind while do this (-;
